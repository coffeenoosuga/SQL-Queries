# SQL Queries – Library & Northwind

This repository contains examples of working with two databases: **Library** and **Northwind**.

## Overview
The project includes SQL queries that demonstrate basic and slightly advanced operations such as:
- `SELECT` – data selection from tables;
- `JOIN` – combining tables;
- `GROUP BY` with aggregate functions;
- `UNION` – combining query results;
- `EXCEPT` – excluding rows from results.

## Purpose
These materials can be useful for:
- learning SQL;
- examples for lab work or practice;
- quick syntax reference for common SQL operations.

## Databases
- **Library** – a test database with books, authors, and readers;
- **Northwind** – a classic sample database with products, suppliers, orders, and customers.
